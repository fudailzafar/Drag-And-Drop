# Drag & Drop Feature

This is a simple drag-and-drop functionality project that allows users to move list items between two boxes. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and provides a smooth drag-and-drop interface.

## Features

- **Drag and Drop**: Users can drag items from one box and drop them into another.
- **Responsive Design**: The project is responsive and works well on different screen sizes.
- **Custom Styling**: Includes custom styles for drag items and boxes.

## File Structure

```bash
│
├── images/                # Folder containing images used in the project
│   └── drag_drop_icon.png  # Image icon used for the drag-and-drop list items
├── index.html             # The main HTML file that contains the structure
├── style.css              # The CSS file that styles the layout and elements
└── script.js              # JavaScript file that handles the drag-and-drop functionality
```

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/drag-and-drop.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd drag-and-drop
   ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser:
   - Right-click `index.html` and open it with your preferred browser.
   - Alternatively, if you have a local web server, start the server and access the project in the browser.

## How It Works

1. Users can drag items from the left box.
2. Items can be dropped into the right box.
3. The drag-and-drop functionality is enabled for both boxes, allowing items to be moved back and forth.
